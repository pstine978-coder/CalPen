# GHOSTCREW

This is an AI red team assistant using large language models with MCP and RAG architecture. It aims to help users perform penetration testing tasks, query security information, analyze network traffic, and more through natural language interaction.

## Features

- **Natural Language Interaction**: Users can ask questions and give instructions to the AI assistant using natural language.
- **MCP Server Integration**: Through the `mcp.json` configuration file, multiple MCP servers can be flexibly integrated and managed to extend the assistant's capabilities.
- **Tool Management**: Configure, connect to, and manage MCP tools through an interactive menu, including the ability to clear all configurations.
- **Tool Invocation**: The AI assistant can call tools provided by configured MCP servers (such as: nmap, metasploit, ffuf, etc.) based on user requests.
- **Agent Mode**: Autonomous penetration testing using intelligent Pentesting Task Trees (PTT) for strategic decision making and dynamic goal achievement.
- **Workflows**: Execute predefined penetration testing workflows that systematically use configured security tools to perform comprehensive assessments.
- **Report Generation**: Generate markdown reports with structured findings, evidence, and recommendations.
- **Conversation History**: Supports multi-turn dialogues, remembering previous interaction content.
- **Streaming Output**: AI responses can be streamed for a better user experience.
- **Knowledge Base Enhancement (Optional)**: Supports enhancing AI responses through a local knowledge base RAG (`knowledge` directory).
- **File-Aware Tool Integration**: AI recognizes and uses actual files from the knowledge folder (wordlists, payloads, configs) with security tools.
- **Configurable Models**: Supports configuration of different language model parameters.

## Installation Guide

1. **Clone Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/GH05TCREW/ghostcrew.git
   cd ghostcrew
   ```

2. **Create and Activate Virtual Environment** (recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   ```
   - Windows:
     ```bash
     .venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - macOS/Linux:
     ```bash
     source .venv/bin/activate
     ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Install MCP Server Dependencies** (Required for tools):
   - **Node.js & npm**: Most MCP security tools require Node.js. Install from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/)
   - **Python uv** (for Metasploit): Install with `pip install uv`
   
   Without these, you can still use GHOSTCREW in chat mode, but automated workflows and tool integration won't be available.

## Usage

1. **Configure MCP Servers**: 
   - Run the application and select "Configure or connect MCP tools" when prompted
   - Use the interactive tool configuration menu to add, configure, or clear MCP tools
   - The configuration is stored in the `mcp.json` file

2. **Prepare Knowledge Base (Optional)**:
   If you want to use the knowledge base enhancement feature, place relevant text files in the `knowledge` folder.

3. **Run the Main Program**:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
   After the program starts, you can:
   - Choose whether to use the knowledge base
   - Configure or activate MCP tools
   - Select between Chat, Workflows, or Agent modes
   - Execute workflows and generate reports
   - Use 'multi' command to enter multi-line input mode for complex queries
   - Enter 'quit' to exit the program

## Input Modes

GHOSTCREW supports two input modes:
- **Single-line mode** (default): Type your query and press Enter to submit
- **Multi-line mode**: Type 'multi' and press Enter, then type your query across multiple lines. Press Enter on an empty line to submit.

## MCP Tool Management

When starting the application, you can:
1. Connect to specific tools
2. Configure new tools
3. Connect to all tools
4. Skip connection
5. Clear all tools (resets mcp.json)

## Available MCP Tools

GHOSTCREW supports integration with the following security tools through the MCP protocol:

1. **AlterX** - Subdomain permutation and wordlist generation tool
2. **Amass** - Advanced subdomain enumeration and reconnaissance tool
3. **Arjun** - Hidden HTTP parameters discovery tool
4. **Assetfinder** - Passive subdomain discovery tool
5. **Certificate Transparency** - SSL certificate transparency logs for subdomain discovery (no executable needed)
6. **FFUF Fuzzer** - Fast web fuzzing tool for discovering hidden content
7. **HTTPx** - Fast HTTP toolkit and port scanning tool
8. **Hydra** - Password brute-force attacks and credential testing tool
9. **Katana** - Fast web crawling with JavaScript parsing tool
10. **Masscan** - High-speed network port scanner
11. **Metasploit** - Penetration testing framework with exploit execution, payload generation, and session management
12. **Nmap Scanner** - Network discovery and security auditing tool
13. **Nuclei Scanner** - Template-based vulnerability scanner
14. **Scout Suite** - Cloud security auditing tool

# OpenAI API configurations
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
OPENAI_BASE_URL=https://api.openai.com/v1
MODEL_NAME=gpt-4o
```

This configuration uses OpenAI's API for both the language model and embeddings (when using the knowledge base RAG feature).

## Configuration File (`mcp.json`)

This file is used to define MCP servers that the AI assistant can connect to and use. Most MCP servers require Node.js or Python to be installed on your system. Each server entry should include:
- `name`: Unique name of the server.
- `params`: Parameters needed to start the server, usually including `command` and `args`.
- `cache_tools_list`: Whether to cache the tools list.

**MCP Example Server Configuration**:

**stdio**
```json
{
  "name": "Nmap Scanner",
  "params": {
    "command": "npx",
    "args": [
      "-y", 
      "gc-nmap-mcp"
    ],
    "env": {
      "NMAP_PATH": "C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Nmap\\nmap.exe"
    }
  },
  "cache_tools_list": true
}
```
Make sure to replace the path to the Nmap executable with your own installation path.

**sse**
```json
{"name":"mcpname",
  "url":"http://127.0.0.1:8009/sse"
},
```
